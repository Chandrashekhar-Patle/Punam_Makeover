            PUNAM was born & brought up in Gondia, has a degree in B.Sc in Computer
            Science from Gondwana University in Gadchiroli. She recognized her passion for makeup in 2021.
            She always plumped for makeup during her college days.
            she leaned towards this field and then started her
            journey as makeup artist. And that makes her very experienced in this
            industry. The transformation that was brought after every look and
            hairstyles in that short term caught her fascination. She knew she
            wanted to be the Bridal Makeup Artist in Bhandara….Hard work, dedication
            and zest soon brought her up to the top as a bridal makeup artist
            and makeup educator.
